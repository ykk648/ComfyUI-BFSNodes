"""Multi-Ref Sheet Builder — combine 1-5 reference images into the single
composite reference sheet used by the multi-ref LTX-2 LoRA (source_id=2,
layout=overlap). Same grid convention as the training pipeline's
build_multiref_sheet.py: fixed 512x512 panels, deterministic grid by count
(1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 2x2, 3-top+2-bottom), centered with padding onto a fixed
1536x1024 canvas so every sheet is the same resolution regardless of how
many refs are plugged in.

Panel order = image index order (ref_image_1 -> image0, ref_image_2 ->
image1, ...), matching the training data's image0/image1/... convention.
